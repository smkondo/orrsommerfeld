# Spectral and Pseudospectral Analysis of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation
This repo contains the MATLAB files for the perturbation analysis of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation and is adapted from the MATLAB code found in "Appendix A.6: MATLAB codes for hydrodynamic stability" in "Stability and Transition in Shear Flows" by Peter J. Schmid and Dan S. Henningson (2001).

The Orr-Sommerfeld equation describes the normal velocity of a plane Poiseuille flow and is derived form the linear Navier-Stokes equation. In this matlab code, the streamwise wave number is set to 1 and the spanwise wave number is set to 0. If desired the Reynolds number, wave numbers and the number of modes extracted can be changed by altering the variables specificed in the beginning of the test.m file.
